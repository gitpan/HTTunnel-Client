INSTALLATION

- To install this module type the following:

     % perl Makefile.PL
     % make
     % make test
     % make install

     Note 1: The test suite will require the URL to an Apache::HTTunnel server 
             to run. You will prompted for it during the installation. Please 
             note that that Apache server must also return an HTTP 200 code 
             for a "GET / HTTP/1.0" request. Generally if the server has an 
             index.html file in the document root it will be ok.
